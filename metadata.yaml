description: Though he achieved literary acclaim as a dramatist, most notably with
  the timeless children's classic Peter Pan, author J.M. Barrie tackled many subjects
  over the course of his career, often grappling with philosophical and psychological
  topics. The breadth of his intellect is on full display in Courage, which is the
  text of a stirring and inspirational speech he delivered to a group of graduating
  college students in the early 1920s.
